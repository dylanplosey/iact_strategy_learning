#Learning Simulation Results

The results used to generate the figures from Section VI-E. In other words, the results from our Learning Simulations, which were generated using "simulation_main"

## Nomenclature

The files are named as follows:

- fXX gives the number of features for that simulation: |F| = 4, 8, and 16
- aXX gives the value of alpha for that simulation: alpha = 5, 10, and 20
- nXX.X gives the ratio of noised used for that simulation. We only included these in the name when noise was introduced (i.e., when |F| = 8 and alpha = 10). The values used are noise = 10.0, 20.0, and 40.0.
