# Learning Simulations

This is the code used to generate the simulations in Section VI. This code is written in python; to run this code, use "main.py"

Note: running "main.py" will save the results as a Pickle in your current directory. You can change where the results are saved by modifying line 24 in "main.py." To see what exactly is inside each element of the Pickle, check out the Results class in "saving.py"

We have also included the results from our simulation in the folder "Results." We include the results in a variety of formats, including Pickle, Matfile, and CSVs.
