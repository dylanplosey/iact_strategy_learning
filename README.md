# Iact_Strategy_Learning

The code used to perform the Examples and Simulation in our Paper "Learning the Human's Interaction Strategy" (in process).

## Learning Example

To perform the Example from Section IV-C, use the MATLAB code "robot_learning.m"
This code also uses "sampleFromVector.m"

## Teaching Example

To perform the Example from Section V-D, use the MATLAB code "robot_teaching.m"
This code also uses "sampleFromVector.m" and "normalizer.m"

## Learning Simulations

To perform the Simulations reported in Section VI (Learning Simulations), use the python code "simulation_main.py"
This code also uses "utils.py" and "saving.py"
