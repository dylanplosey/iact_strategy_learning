# Iact_Strategy_Learning

This repository includes the code used to perform the examples and simulations in our paper: "Learning the Human's Interaction Strategy" (in process). We also have included the results from our simulation, which were used to generate the results in our paper.

## Learning Example

This folder contains the code used to generate the example in Section IV-C, where the robot is learning to sort screws from a human expert.

## Teaching Example

This folder contains the code used to generate the example in Section V-D, where the robot is teaching the human which goal it is attempting to reach.

## Simulation

This folder contains the code used to perform the "Learning Simulations" in Section VI. The human provides a policy demonstration, and the robot is attempting to learn the human's reward parameters.
